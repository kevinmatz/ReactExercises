# React.js projects

* **Ravenous** is a project built as part of Codecademy's "Build a Front-End App with React" course; it uses the Yelp API to search and retrieve restaurant listings. (It still needs visual beautification but the core functionality for the proof-of-concept is implemented.)
* **"Jammming"** (in progress) is the final independent project for Codecademy's React course. It accesses the Spotify API and allows users to search for songs, build a playlist, and then save the playlist to the user's Spotify account.
